## About Me

I'm a hands-on engineering leader who thrives at the intersection of **code, people, and product**. Over the past 12+ years, I’ve built, led, and scaled full-stack applications and cloud-native systems from scratch - while managing distributed teams, project roadmaps, and investor expectations.

At the core, I'm a **builder** - but I bring more than just code to the table:
- Led cross-functional teams (engineering, QA, product) across time zones  
- Managed full product roadmaps, delivery cycles, and backlog grooming  
- Collaborated directly with clients and stakeholders to scope, prioritize, and iterate fast  
- 🛠Owned vendor relationships, external team handoffs, and architecture reviews  
- Built and scaled remote teams using **Agile, JIRA, Confluence, Slack**  
- Presented engineering progress in **board meetings, investor audits, and demos**
